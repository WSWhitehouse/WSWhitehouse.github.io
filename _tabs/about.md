Hi there, I'm **William Whitehouse**; I'm a Games Developer and Programmer.

I am currently on my placement year at University, studying [Games Technology BSc(Hons)](https://courses.uwe.ac.uk/G611/games-technology) at the University of the West of England (UWE).

I am an avid gamer; my favourite game is Minecraft - which I love to play on a technical level. I design and make complicated contraptions from scratch, including a fully automatic item sorter, a potion brewing lab and various mob farms. I'm a massive fan of the role-playing game Skyrim, which I have played through multiple times - each time with a different playstyle (archer, swordsman, lawful, evil, etc.).

I love playing games, but I love working on games even more. I develop open-source tools to help other developers and release them publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/WSWhitehouse). I participate in game jams whenever I can - which is a great way to continuously improve my skills. In my spare time, I work on my personal projects (which I occasionally blog about). Previous projects include [Raymarching in Unity](https://github.com/WSWhitehouse/Unity-Raymarching) and making my own [Vulkan Game Engine in C++](https://github.com/WSWhitehouse/my-first-vulkan-engine). Check out my [portfolio](https://williamwhitehouse.dev/portfolio/) for a more in-depth look at my work.

I'm passionate about learning and constantly looking to advance in my field. I find reading technical books very interesting and love learning about new programming patterns and design philosophies. I've read books such as `Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time`, which has been incredibly valuable when working in a team.

When I'm not on my PC, I like to take long walks and visit the local climbing & bouldering gym with friends. I enjoy cooking meals for myself and trying new foods.
